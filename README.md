# Election_Analysis
Python

After sharing the election audit with the election commission, Seth is asked by the election commission if his team can confirm the voter turnout for each county that voted in this congressional district. 

The PyPoll_challenge.py used for loops and conditional statements to calculate and display the voter turnout per county and canididate on election_analtsis.txt.
The results displayed were the total votes along with county names, percentage of totoal votes, and county vote count. The python terminal also shows the largest county turnot winner along with the the canidates name, vote count and percentage of total votes. To show the clear winner, at the end of the code it displays the winners name, vote count, and percentage of total votes.
